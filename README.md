Webfaction-Python-API
---------------------

Webfaction Python 2 and 3 API is supported.



This is a port of https://pypi.python.org/pypi/webf/ -- the repo exists because

A. There doesn't seem to be a good source listing anymore (original site is dead)
B. I wanted to modify it to accept passed-in credentials instead of having one config file
